# Core principles

- UX irreprochable (best in class user journey)
- Whichever functionality there is irreprochable, as opposed to many unfinished functionality
- UI simple

# What I've learnt

## Overall lessons

#### Be first or be best
Striking the balance is key. It was clear to me that other people would have the idea, but I thought that taking the overall app quality a notch higher I could still have a significant impact.

#### Focus first on the most important things, not the easiest
Easy to get bogged down in UI details and little refinements (it's fun to do). But the core functionality is more important. In the end when you have to launch, it's clear what should have been the priority.

#### Alpha test ASAP
As an app designer/developer I am careful to make sound design choices that I think will be best for users (it's one of the core principles of this app). It's foolish to think that I will always make the right choices. And that's why it's crucial to get users to test it as soon and as often as possible. Even if it's just mom/dad/bro.
Example: the Define Home Flow in 1.0 was using a marker on the map slightly offset from the center. When you zoom you lose the marker completely. It was spotted in 30s by the first non-me user. 


## Android stuff

- bindService vs startService
- Notification channels and how finicky they are (impossible to update after creation?!)
